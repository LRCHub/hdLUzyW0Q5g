I've had enough of this evil day
Cause you don't listen to a word I say
You just tell me that I'm gonna feel better
When my head gets buried in your sweater

I saved the butt from your cigar
I smoked it with the Queen of Myanmar
Ramadan riot and the screams awoke us
You and your sister put my fuck in focus

Monkey hangers got shit to give
But even monkey hangers have a place to live now
A little town on the seaside

I got the why and the whatnot friend
But you forgot to let me know when
Unnatural beauty wins again

Her heart races when you open the door
And you remind her what a lock is for
Take all the credit where credit is due
I take all the credit give none to you

You said one, two, ready, let's go
We're gonna go drinking where the amoral tits go
Big red, she's a big, big bird
Finding life here would be most absurd

Money hangers are kids to me
But even monkey hangers have a place to be
A little town in Teesside

You're making noise like a hungry cat
Without a clue where the rubbish is at
Unnatural beauty does that

Monkey town
Monkey town
Monkey town
Should of let that monkey drown
Monkey town
Monkey town
Should of let that monkey drown
Monkey town
Monkey town
Should of let that monkey drown
Monkey town
Monkey town
Should of let that monkey drown
Monkey town
